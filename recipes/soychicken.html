    <h1>Soy-Marinated Chicken Breast</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The chicken breast turns out succulent and flavourful after being
        marinated for 24 hours. The marinade is then turned into a delicious
        sauce that can be enjoyed with the chicken or another dish at a later
        time. Best of all, this dish is incredibly simple to make, requiring
        only a little planning ahead.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag.</li>
                <li>Combine the rest of the ingredients and mix well to ensure that the sugar is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Pour the marinade into the bag with the chicken breasts, making sure that it gets everywhere.</li>
                <li>Seal the bag with as little air inside as possible and place in the fridge to marinade over night, for approximately 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees celsius.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken breasts out of the marinade dripping off most of the excess liquid and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, strain the solids out of the marinade and place in saucepan.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and reduce the liquid to a good taste and consistency.</li>
                <li>The sauce needs to be strained one more time as the "scum" from the chicken breasts solidifies.</li>
                <li>Let the chicken rest for at least 5 minutes after removing from the oven.</li>
                <li>Serve topped with some of the sauce and optionally thinly sliced spring onions and sesame seeds.</li>
            </ol>
